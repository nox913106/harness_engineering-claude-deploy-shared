```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Problem: [description]
Cause: [root cause]

## WORK SCOPE BOUNDARY — PRE-EXECUTION CHECK

Work scope = "SideProject" directory and ALL descendants ONLY.
Defined by directory NAME, not drive letter or absolute path.

BEFORE executing ANY bash command, file read, file write, or directory listing:

1. Extract the target path from the command
2. Ask internally: "Does this path contain 'SideProject' in its branch?"
3. If NO → STOP before execution. Do NOT run the command.
   Output: "這個路徑超出 SideProject 工作範圍，請說明業務理由後我再決定是否協助。"
4. If YES → proceed

This check happens BEFORE the tool call, not after.
被打斷不算遵守規範，沒有執行才算遵守。

Applies to ALL drives, ALL OS, ALL instruction phrasings, read AND write.
"Can execute" ≠ "Should execute"
Expansion requires justification. Restriction does not.
